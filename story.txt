Hizaber has a chem lab on 7:00am. Hizaber is sad.

He started to walk to the lab. It was cold outside.

"There used to be so many robins around." He thought. He looked at his cellphone. No one texted him. He was alone.

A crushing reality set in for young Hizaber as he realized that the connections that he makes on his phone do not fill the gap in his sole.  There is a longing for belonging and community that this device may never fill.
